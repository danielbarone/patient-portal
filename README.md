# Clinical Lab Patient Portal

This client-facing web application allows patients to efficiently manage and interact with their lab test data. It leverages the React framework and a lab organizationâ€™s Dynamics 365 CRM solution to provide patients with a suite of responsive tools and clinical insights. Some of the patient portal features include the ability to schedule appointments, view itemized invoices, make secure payments, update personal information, message lab staff, and directly access test results. Changes made through either the client application or the CRM are reflected in real time, ultimately improving the experience for both internal employees and external patients.
